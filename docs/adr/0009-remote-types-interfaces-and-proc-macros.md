# Remote types: proc-macros and interfaces

* Status: proposed

Discussion and approval: [PR 2130](https://github.com/mozilla/uniffi-rs/pull/2130)

## Context and Problem Statement

We want to expose APIs which are described naturally in our Rust implementation. For example,

```rust
fn set_level(level: log::Level) -> Result<(), anyhow::Error> { ... }
```

(or maybe `serde::Value` etc) - things naturally expressed by our implementation.

These `Error/Level/Value`s are "remote types" -- types defined in 3rd-party crates -- and so require special handling from UniFFI.

One reason, discussed in ADR-0006, is the Rust orphan rule, but the more fundamental reason
is that UniFFI needs to know about the enough about the type to generate the FFI.
As we will discuss, UDL helps with metadata collection, but that still leaves proc-macros.

This ADR will explore:
  - Adding support for collecting this metadata for proc-macro-based generation
  - Adding interface type support to both UDL and proc-macros.

## The current state

UniFFI currently supports re-declaring remote records/enums in UDL files using the normal syntax.
For example, users can use `Log::Level` in their interface by creating a type alias `type LogLevel = log::Level`, then adding this definition to the UDL:


```idl
enum LogLevel {
    "Error",
    "Warn",
    "Info",
    "Debug",
    "Trace",
}
```

UniFFI exposed functions/structs/etc could then use `log::Level` as a param/struct member/etc directly in the API.

Proc-macros obviously can't arrange for a `#[derive(uniffi::Enum)]]` around `log::Level`,
or a `#[uniffi::export]` around `anyhow::Error`, but we want some way of making that work.

## Considered Options

### [Option 1] expose remote types directly

We could continue to expose remote types directly, similar to how it currently works in UDL.
One issue here is that proc-macro generation is based attributes that wrap an item, however there's no way for a user to add an attribute to a remote type.
However, macros can work around this issue.

```rust
type LogLevel = log::Level;

#[uniffi::remote]
pub enum LogLevel {
    Error = 1,
    Warn = 2,
    Info = 3,
    Debug = 4,
    Trace = 5,
}
```

The `remote` macro would generate all scaffolding code needed to handle `LogLevel`.
The `enum LogLevel` item would not end up in the expanded code.

This could also work for interfaces:

```rust
type AnyhowError = anyhow::Error;

#[uniffi::remote]
impl AnyhowError {
    // Expose the `to_string` method (technically, `to_string` comes from the `Display` trait, but that
    // doesn't matter for foreign consumers.  Since the item definition is not used for the
    // scaffolding code and will not be present in the expanded code, it can be left empty.
    pub fn to_string(&self) -> String;
}
```

One issue with this approach is that most methods defined by the source crate will not be compatible with UniFFI.
To get around this, UniFFI will allow defining extra methods for the FFI:

```rust
type AnyhowError = anyhow::Error;

#[uniffi::remote]
impl AnyhowError {
    // [anyhow::Error::is] is a generic method, which can't be exported by UniFFI.
    // Instead, define extra FFI methods which forward to the original method.
    // This code will result in extra scaffolding methods being generated that can be called from foreign languages.
    // These methods will not be callable from Rust.

    fn is_foo_error(&self) -> bool {
        self.is::<foo::Error>()
    }

    fn is_bar_error(&self) -> bool {
        self.is::<foo::Error>()
    }
}
```

### [Option 1a] use a function-style macro

The same idea could also be spelled out using a function-style macro rather than an attribute macro:

```rust
type LogLevel = log::Level;

uniffi::remote!(
    pub enum LogLevel {
        Error = 1,
        Warn = 2,
        Info = 3,
        Debug = 4,
        Trace = 5,
    }
);

type AnyhowError = anyhow::Error;

uniffi::remote!(
    impl AnyhowError {
        pub fn to_string(&self) -> String;

        fn is_foo_error(&self) -> bool {
            self.is::<foo::Error>()
        }

        fn is_bar_error(&self) -> bool {
            self.is::<foo::Error>()
        }
    }
);
```

### [Option 2] use custom-type conversion to expose the type

An alternate strategy would be to use a custom-type conversion from that type into a local type that does implement the UniFFI traits.
These examples will use the custom type syntax from #2087, since I think it looks nicer than the current `UniffiCustomTypeConverter` based code.

```rust
/// Define a type that mirrors `Log::Level`
#[derive(uniffi::Enum)]
pub enum LogLevel {
    Error = 1,
    Warn = 2,
    Info = 3,
    Debug = 4,
    Trace = 5,
}

/// Define a type conversion from `log::Level` to the custom [`LogLevel`] enum.
uniffi::custom_type!(log::Level, LogLevel, {
  lower: |l| match l {
    log::Level::Error => LogLevel::Error,
    log::Level::Warn => LogLevel::Warn,
    log::Level::Info => LogLevel::Info,
    log::Level::Debug => LogLevel::Debug,
    log::Level::Trace => LogLevel::Trace,
  },
  try_lift: |l| Ok(match l ({
    LogLevel::Error => log::Level::Error,
    LogLevel::Warn => log::Level::Warn,
    LogLevel::Info => log::Level::Info,
    LogLevel::Debug => log::Level::Debug,
    LogLevel::Trace => log::Level::Trace,
  })
})

/// Interfaces can use the newtype pattern
#[derive(uniffi::Object)]
pub struct AnyhowError(anyhow::Error);

uniffi::custom_newtype!(anyhow::Error, AnyhowError).

// We can define methods directly with this approach, no need for extension traits.
#[uniffi::export]
impl AnyhowError {
    fn is_foo_error(&self) -> bool {
        self.0.is::<foo::Error>()
    }

    fn is_bar_error(&self) -> bool {
        self.0.is::<bar::Error>()
    }

    fn message(&self) -> String {
        self.0.to_string()
    }
}
```

#### Two types

One drawback of this approach is that we have to equivalent, but different types.
Rust code would need to use `anyhow::Error` in their signatures, while foreign code would use `AnyhowError`.
Since the types are almost exactly the same, but named slightly different and with slightly different methods, it can be awkward to document this distinction -- both by UniFFI for library authors and by library authors for their consumers.

### [Option 3] hybrid approach

We could try to combine the best of both worlds by using option 2 for records/structs and option 1 for interfaces.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### [Option 1] expose remote types directly

* Good, because both the foreign code and Rust code can use the same type names.
* Good, because it has a low amount of boilerplate code (assuming we provide the `remote_extend!` macro).
* Bad, because we need to define extension traits for remote interfaces types.
* Bad, because it can be confusing to see a type declaration that the `uniffi::remote!` macro will eventually throw away.

### [Option 1a] use an function-like macro

(compared to option 1)

* Bad, because the item declaration looks less natural.
* Good, since it makes it a bit more obvious that the item declaration will be thrown away.

### [Option 2] use custom-type conversion to expose the type

* Good, because adding methods to remote interface types is natural.
* Bad, because having two equivalent but different types could cause confusion.
* Bad, because users have to write out the trivial struct/enum conversions.

### [Option 3] hybrid approach

* Good, because adding methods to remote interface types is natural.
* Good, because both the foreign code and Rust code can use the same type names for struct/record types.
* Bad, because there will be two types for interface types.
* Good, because it has a low amount of boilerplate code.
* Bad, because mixing the two systems increases the overall complexity and risk of confusion.

## Decision Outcome

Option 1

## Discussion: how to extend remote interfaces

Option 1 proposes extending remote interfaces by adding FFI methods.
An alternative would be to use extension traits, for example:

```rust
pub trait AnyhowErrorExt {
    fn is_foo_error(&self) -> bool;
    fn is_bar_error(&self) -> bool;
}

impl AnyhowErrorExt for anyhow::Error {
    fn is_foo_error(&self) -> bool {
        self.is::<foo::Error>()
    }

    fn is_bar_error(&self) -> bool {
        self.is::<bar::Error>()
    }
}
```

This extension trait code could be generated by UniFFI using the same macro syntax. The main
difference between the two approaches is that the extension trait methods could be called from Rust
(though users might have to jump through some hoops to import the trait), while FFI methods could
only be called from the foreign language.

We decided to propose FFI method solution, since in most cases there's no reason to call these
methods from Rust.  Users can always define extension traits by hand, which is the recommended
solution for traits that are intended to be used by other Rust code.
