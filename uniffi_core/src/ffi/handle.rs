/// Object handle
///
/// Handles opaque `u64` values used to pass objects across the FFI, both for objects implemented in
/// Rust and ones implemented in the foreign language.
///
/// Rust handles are generated by leaking a raw pointer
/// Foreign handles are generated with a handle map that only generates odd values.
/// For all currently supported architectures and hopefully any ones we add in the future:
/// * 0 is an invalid value.
/// * The lowest bit will always be set for foreign handles and never set for Rust ones (since the
///   leaked pointer will be aligned).
///
/// Foreign handles for internal bindings languages look like this:
///   * Bits 0-48 are the map key.  Keys are always odd, so the lowest bit is always set.
///   * Bits 48-64 are the map identifier, used to detect using a handle with the wrong map
///
/// External bindings authors are free to use any form they want for their handles, as long the lowest bit is set.
/// In particular, they don't need to implement the map identifier.
///
/// Rust handles are mainly managed is through the [crate::HandleAlloc] trait.
